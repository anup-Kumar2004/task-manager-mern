# Task Manager MERN Application

This is a simple **Task Management Application** built using the **MERN Stack** (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js). The application supports basic CRUD operations for managing tasks and demonstrates a clean code structure following the MVC architecture.


### Functional Requirements

#### **Task Features**
- Create tasks with a title and description.
- View a list of all tasks.
- Update a task's title and description.
- Delete tasks individually.

#### **Backend**

- `GET /tasks` - Fetch all tasks.
- `POST /tasks` - Create a new task.
- `PUT /tasks/:id` - Update a specific task.
- `DELETE /tasks/:id` - Delete a specific task.

#### **Frontend**
- A form to add or update tasks.
- A list view to display all tasks.
- Options to edit or delete each task.
- Success/error messages after operations.

### **Non-Functional Requirements**
- Clean folder structure with separate directories for backend and frontend.
- Follows the **MVC architecture** for backend development.
- Uses environment variables for managing sensitive data (e.g., MongoDB connection strings).
